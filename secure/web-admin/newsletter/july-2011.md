New Stuff
=========

* Hello! Hope you like our rebooted newsletter
* New mini site: PetitionYourCouncil.com 
* New: Keep tabs on what’s coming up in Parliament
* Get on board our new transport project

Petition your council
---------------------

We have a brand new site! Small but useful,
[PetitionYourCouncil](http://www.petitionyourcouncil.com) helps you  find out
whether your local council has an online petitions site, and takes you there if
it does.

Petitions are an ancient way to tell governments what people want, and we
wanted to help more citizens to realise that they have the power to submit
petitions to their councils via the internet. [Check it
out](http://www.petitionyourcouncil.com/)!

See into the future
-------------------

Previously, you could only use our parliamentary site
[TheyWorkForYou](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/) to see things that have
already happened. But it’s pretty obvious that you can’t change things in the
past. 

**We’ve now added [upcoming
business](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/calendar/)**, so you’ll always know
when something’s going to happen in Parliament that matters to you. 

**Hint**: To get sent alerts as soon as we know about an event you’d be
interested in, just visit the new page, type in a word or phrase that you’d
like to be alerted about in future in the “Search upcoming business” box, and
click go. Once the results page arrives, click “Subscribe”.

Fixing up FixMyStreet
---------------------

Meanwhile, [FixMyStreet](http://www.fixmystreet.com/) has introduced **user
accounts**. So now you can:

* Report problems and leave updates without having to confirm by email
* View all the reports and updates that you have made
* See a summary map of your reports

We also have shiny new **zoomable maps**, something that we know many of you
have been asking for, and we hope this will make problem reporting in rural or
unfamiliar areas much easier. We’ll be blogging more details about all this
soon.

We've been working on the railroad
----------------------------------

OK, not **technically** on the railroad itself, but we have been working on our
biggest new project for two years - [FixMyTransport](http://fixmytransport.com)
- and it’s nearly ready to launch.

It’s going to be all about helping people to get public transport problems
fixed, but before it launches we need some help from you, the lovely people in
our community of users and supporters.

We need two kinds of help in particular. First, we need your [help collecting
contact details](http://bit.ly/k8crMU) for the nation’s transport companies, and second we need people
with actual transport issues to report them through the site as beta testers in
a couple of weeks’ time - drop us a line at [team@fixmytransport.com](mailto:team@fixmytransport.com) if you’d
like to be one of the first to try the site out.

Freedom, now 14% off
--------------------

Our Freedom of Information website WhatDoTheyKnow is now used by people like
you to make over 14% of all the FOI requests that get sent to central
government departments in the UK. To see why this makes us happy, and why it’s
a good thing, read [this blog post](http://www.mysociety.org/2011/07/01/whatdotheyknow%E2%80%99s-share-of-central-government-foi-requests-%E2%80%93-q2-2011/).
